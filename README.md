# bitbox-bbgunner
have a duel with your friend on the bitbox.

## TODO

* player health bar doesn't show when 100% for some reason.

* when "radar" (red line) is nearly horizontal, there are too many computations per line.
need a better algorithm (write many pixels at once instead of one at a time).
