# bitbox-bbgunner
have a duel with your friend on the bitbox.

![Picture of duel](https://github.com/lowagner/lowagner.github.io/blob/master/i/bbgunner.png)

## TODO

* currently the bitbox lib is not allowing two player input.  so,
for now you can't duel your friends, sorry.

* player health bar doesn't show when 100% for some reason.
